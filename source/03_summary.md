# Abstract {.unnumbered}

<!-- This is the abstract -->

As a cosmopolitan city, Hong Kong is also a fashion city. Hong Kong has trained a lot of young and creative professional fashion talents. Some of them can step out of Hong Kong to enter the international arena and promote the integration of Chinese and Western cultures and Hong Kong's unique culture to the world. However, at present, there are not many ways for new designers to promote their designs to other places. The purpose of this project is to develop and provide a cross-platform web platform for young designers to promote their finished designs.
