# Critical Evaluation

Unlike what the project have anticipated from the very beginning, it faced many challenges during the development of the system which led the project to change the strategy in turn of development focus. The project had to leave the web store at its basic function state in order to catch up on the schedule. And over the course of the development, the project have come across some aspect that it have overthought before, like the development of the mobile application of the platform. It is prove that although there are some variation between the initial planning and actually development, it was able to retain most of its intended values and functionalities through flexible implementation.

## Changes to design and justifications

As time moved on while developing the platform, it encountered many different challenges and difficulties. It was able to tackle some of them, like some changes to mobile application design in order to have the mobile application work better with the platform. But some of the challenges were so difficult that we have to straight the project postpone the development of the function, like the in-store purchase, it was unable to use in the latest version of React Native, and due to the upcoming deadline of the project, it had to regrettably put aside its development and focus on the rest of the platform.

## Quality of implementation

As the project did some changes to the design to the overall of the platform, the implementation of the actual platform does a huge different from the previously designed one. For example, the project has to shift the focus entirely away from the building of the web store and cut off the mobile application for designers to ensure the development of the rest of the platform is close to the requirement of the CST student. But overall, most of the users retain their intended functions, the designers are still available to control their settings, and have data analyse service. Customers can browser and search the product from the web store and mobile application. As for the programming techniques, Magento is the main framework for the web application and React Native is used in iOS and Android application.

## Development Difficulties

Since the project time period limitation and the requirement of the CST student, the mainly development in this project will more force on how to use a cross-platform language can be use to built a native like mobile application that can function on both iOS and Android system. Therefore, the web store with Mangeto is only have the basic function that provided by the framework and the development of the mobile application for designers is cut off.

In addition, the version of the React Native I used is the latest version. However, some of the plugins are not yet support the latest one, like use Apple Pay / Google Pay for in-store purchase, therefore it cannot be provided in this demo. 

Lastly, the image recognition function need a huge library which have trained. During to the time limited,  MobileNet pre-trained model is used for the image recognition. The data which the model provided is not what this project need, therefore it is only for demo usage only.
