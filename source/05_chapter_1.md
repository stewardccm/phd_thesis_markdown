# Introduction

An online store that provides backend management systems gives emerging designers and smaller brands a platform for them to place their designs. The difference between this platform and other platforms is that designers and brands can cooperate with each other. There can be finished products of different designers in a piece of clothing advice provided to consumers, and it is no longer limited to the same brand or designer's products. At the same time, designers no longer need the platform as an intermediary to communicate with customers. They can directly contact customers to understand their needs and provide corresponding solutions, reducing the time required for intermediary communication and speeding up their problem resolution.

Cross-platform mobile applications not only expand designer and brand promotion channels, but also allow them to monitor and manage their product data at any time and place. As mobile shopping becomes the daily life of the general public, a cross-platform mobile application is necessary and an important way to give consumers know more new brands and promote them to more people through their social platforms.
