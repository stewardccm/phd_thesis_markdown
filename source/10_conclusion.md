# Result and conclusion

As a summary to the entire development of the system, it was surely full of challenges and changes. One of the major problems that the project faced was cease of development of the web store and mobile application for designers, it is because as CST student, we were supposed to focus on the development of the software technology portion of the system. The shift of the focus from the system development to technology ensures the build quality of the software technology and makes sure it would be delivered in the schedule that the project planned. There are some limitations to the platform, for example, the platform do not have filter for filter the unrelated information or products which uploaded by designers.



## Future development

1. The control measures function

   Since we have to protect the rights of the designer and customers, some function like add the watermark and filter the non related information need to provide in the platform.

2. Offline support

   We can connect with the offline store to let the designers has more way to promote their design and have more data collection.

3. Customised service

   Some of the customers are looking for the customised service but not the finished project. It is a chance to let different designers to provide their ideas and even get some resource.
